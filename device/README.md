# Device

This directory contains a Rust application that runs on a target embedded board. The current app is just the default hello_world app generated by cargo. Any device-specific code/configuration/dependencies will need to be added as part of the development process. You can use any embedded board you have available, use an emulator, or just pick a STM32 target of your choosing and not test on real hardware. The app should be able to be deployed and run on a target board using `cargo run`. The end goal of the device app is to be able to communicate with the server app via serial connection to command device peripherals.

Note: If you're using a STM32 development board, prefer to use the ST-LINK serial connection for communications. This makes it easier to test without having to do additional wiring on our end. Additionally use the built-in LEDs/buttons on the board for any peripheral interactions.
